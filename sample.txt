Giraffes may be preyed on by lions, leopards, spotted hyenas and African wild dogs.
Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are gregarious and may gather in large aggregations.
Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon.
Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.
